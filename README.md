# Coroutines Codelab

In this codelab you'll learn how to use Kotlin Coroutines in an Android appâ€”the recommended way of managing background threads that can simplify code by reducing the need for callbacks.

Coroutines are a Kotlin feature that converts async callbacks for long-running tasks, such as database or network access, into sequential code.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with the Architecture Components ViewModel, LiveData, Repository, and Room.
Experience with Kotlin syntax, including extension functions and lambdas.
A basic understanding of using threads on Android, including the main thread, background threads, and callbacks.

## What you'll do

Call code written with coroutines and obtain results.
Use suspend functions to make async code sequential.
Use launch and runBlocking to control how code executes.
Learn techniques to convert existing APIs to coroutines using suspendCoroutine.
Use coroutines with Architecture Components.
Learn best practices for testing coroutines.

## What you'll need
Android Studio 4.1 (the codelab may work with other versions, but some things might be missing or look different).
If you run into any issues (code bugs, grammatical errors, unclear wording, etc.) as you work through this codelab, please report the issue via the Report a mistake link in the lower left corner of the codelab.
